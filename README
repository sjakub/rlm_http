OVERVIEW

 This is a FreeRADIUS module, that will try to perform
 a remote HTTP server request using HTTP basic auth.
 It can be configured to use GET or POST
 requests, and to send POST payload to the server.

INSTALLATION

 - Copy the entire rlm_http directory to src/modules/
   in FreeRADIUS source tree.
 - Add 'rlm_http' at the end of src/modules/stable file
 - Configure and build FreeRADIUS
 - Install FreeRADIUS
 - Modify its configuration to use http module

   By default (and for installations that use / prefix),
   modify /etc/raddb/sites-available/default
   and add 'http' line in 'authorize' section (before pap module)
   In 'authenticate' section add following:
  
    Auth-Type HTTP {
      http
    }

   Also, create /etc/raddb/modules/http file with
   the configuration to be used by this module. For instance:

    http {
      host         = example.com
      port         = 80
      timeout      = 5
      url          = /url/to/use/
      method       = POST
      payload      = '{ "json_key": [ "var1", "var2", "var3" ] }'
      payload_type = 'application/json'
    }
